Based on these findings, we are pleased to share the following recommendations for a successful crowfunding campaign for "Fever":
* Lower the initial goal of $10,000 to $5,000-$7,000.
* Consider launching two different campaigns between $5,000-$7,000 with different target backers. 
* Launch the campaign in the beginning of the summer months, and before the start of the fall season.
